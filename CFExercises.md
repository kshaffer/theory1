## Error detection

For each of the following *cantus firmi*, determine the error(s) in the melody. Then add/delete/replace notes to fix the errors. Note that you are likely to make *new* errors, especially early on, when you make those changes, so repeat the process again until you are confident it exemplifies the principles of [strict *cantus firmus* composition](http://openmusictheory.com/cantusFirmus.html).

## Composition

Try building a well formed *cantus* around the following skeleton. Length, starting pitch, penultimate pitch, ending pitch, and climax have been provided. Create a smooth, consonant melodic line that exemplifies the characteristics listed above—both the specific characteristics of strict species *cantus firmi* and the general characteristics of tonal melodies. Click the staff to hear the melody. Be sure to listen each time you make a change.
