## Error detection

For each of the following second-species counterpoints, determine the error(s) in the exercise. First, sing the exercises and note what is easy/difficult to perform, and also note what sounds expected/unexpected, smooth/jarring, etc. Then click on the quotation mark in the Trinket exercise to begin adding intervals as lyrics: P8, M3, m6, etc. Notating intervals (and updating them as you change notes) will help you notice more subtle errors in the counterpoint.

After noting where your musical instincts direct you, begin to add/delete/replace notes **in the counterpoint** to fix the errors you find. (Do not change the cantus firmus ― the alto clef line.) Note that you are likely to make *new* errors, especially early on, when you make those changes, so repeat the process again until you are confident it exemplifies the principles of [strict second-species composition](http://openmusictheory.com/secondSpecies.html).
