## Schedule

***Due Thursday, November 5, 8am:*** *Unit II project draft*   
***Due Tuesday, November 10, 8am:*** *Unit II project*   


## Overview

*Compose* and *perform* a melody and chordal accompaniment that is four phrases long and uses one of the following pop/rock chord progressions:

- 50s Doo-Wop  
- Singer/songwriter (any version)

Submit both a score of your composition (handwritten or notation software) and a video of your performance to D2L.


## Details



## Submission

This project contains two parts to turn in.

First, create **a score** that contains three staves: the lead-sheet staff (melody, lyrics, lead-sheet chord symbols), and a two-staff, chordal keyboard part (using the chord voicings and *Law of the Shortest Way* that we have explored in the context of basso-continuo style voice-leading). On the score, citcle each non-chord tone in the melody and label it according to its embellishing-tone type. Underneath the keyboard part, provide a Roman-numeral and figured-bass analysis of your harmonic progression. This score can be handwritten, but if you know how to use notation software, please use that instead. (We will be learning some basics of notation software starting next unit and into next semester.) **If handwritten, please scan or take a legible picture of your score and submit the PDF or JPG file to D2L. If you use notation software, please export a PDF of your score and submit the PDF.**

Record yourself performing your composition **on video.** You should sing the melody (with text, no need for solfège in this project) while simultaneously playing the chords on keyboard, guitar, harp, marimba, or some other instrument capable of playing the chordal texture. You are welcome to take it slow and play a single block chord per bar, or you can "comp" it according to the style. We will not be judging the quality of your instrumental performance, so much as asking you to connect the theory, composition, and performance together as you work. Thus, we will simply evaluate your ability to put these two aspects together with basic accuracy of pitch and rhythm. 

Please make sure that we can see who it is performing. :)


## Assessment

The project will be assessed in light of the following musical objectives:

- Correct pitch content *and voicing* (doubling) of the chords.  
- Keyboard part generally follows the Law of the Shortest Way. (Some exceptions are okay — in order to keep the right hand on the staff, for example.)  
- Melody is composed entirely of chord tones and proper embellishing tones.  
- Embellishing tones are accurately labeled.  
- Lead-sheet symbols are accurate.  
- Roman numerals and figured bass (inversions) are accurate.  
- Video performance stays at a (relatively) steady tempo.  
- Video performance generally displays rhythmic accuracy.  
- Video performance of the melody displays pitch accuracy.  
- Video performance of the chordal part displays pitch accuracy.  

Each of these objectives will be assessed on a three-point scale:
