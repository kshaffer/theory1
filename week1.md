Then take three quizzes in D2L:

- Reading quiz – Sept 1 (not timed, open-note, collaboration allowed)  
- Key Signature ID – Sept 1 (3 minutes, one attempt allowed, open-note, no collaboration)  
- Pitch ID – Sept 1 (3 minutes, one attempt allowed, open-note, no collaboration)

You can find the quizzes by going to [learn.colorado.edu](http://learn.colorado.edu), selecting Semester 1 Theory, clicking on "Content", and then clicking on "Unit I: Melody and musical fundamentals".

I highly recommend that you go to "Practice fundamentals quizzes" first, and take each practice quiz a few times. It will help you get used to D2L timed quizzes before you do one that "counts," and it will give you a chance to practice and build your fluency.
