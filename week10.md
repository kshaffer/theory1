## Assignments

### For Tuesday, October 27, 7am

Complete [Written Assignment No. 5]({{ site.url }}/media/WritingAssignment5.pdf). Print the PDF, complete it, and hand it in at the beginning of class. Be sure to follow *all of the instructions* on the assignment. As usual, keep in mind that there is often more than one legitimate musical interpretation. If you can match what you hear to specific musical details that support it, you're on the right track. This assignment will count toward the application assignments part of your course grade.

Note that this assignment does *not* include basso-continuo style reduction/voice-leading. The reduction part of this assignment is the same as Asst. 4.

There is no reading/quiz for Tuesday.

### For Thursday, October 29, 8am

Complete the melodic fragment you began composing on Tuesday, and be prepared to volunteer to perform it for the class (only a few volunteers will actually do so). The melody should draw two lines of rhyming text from the [Pentametron Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/pentametron), and should set each line of text to a natural-sounding rhythm and one cycle of the ["singer/songwriter" chord progression](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockHarmony.html). You may complete these on your own or with a partner. These will not be graded.


### For Tuesday, November 2, 7am

Either re-submit your [Written Assignment No. 5]({{ site.url }}/media/WritingAssignment5.pdf), if you are happy with it, or redo it and submit the redo on Tuesday. (Print the PDF, complete it, and hand it in at the beginning of class, if you did not get a new handout on Thursday.) Be sure to follow *all of the instructions* on the assignment. As usual, keep in mind that there is often more than one legitimate musical interpretation. If you can match what you hear to specific musical details that support it, you're on the right track. Keep in mind the clarifications made during Thursday's class and the feedback you received from each other as you complete this. This assignment will count toward the application assignments part of your course grade and will replace the lower grade of Assignment 3 or Assignment 4.

Note that this assignment does *not* include basso-continuo style reduction/voice-leading. The reduction part of this assignment is the same as Asst. 4.

There is no reading/quiz for Tuesday. However, please review the following previous readings (or others from *Open Music Theory*) as necessary.
