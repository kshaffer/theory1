## Assignments

### For Tuesday, November 3, 8am

Either re-submit your [Written Assignment No. 5]({{ site.url }}/media/WritingAssignment5.pdf), if you are happy with it, or redo it and submit the redo on Tuesday. (Print the PDF, complete it, and hand it in at the beginning of class, if you did not get a new handout on Thursday.) Be sure to follow *all of the instructions* on the assignment. As usual, keep in mind that there is often more than one legitimate musical interpretation. If you can match what you hear to specific musical details that support it, you're on the right track. Keep in mind the clarifications made during Thursday's class and the feedback you received from each other as you complete this. This assignment will count toward the application assignments part of your course grade and will replace the lower grade of Assignment 3 or Assignment 4.

Note that this assignment does *not* include basso-continuo style reduction/voice-leading. The reduction part of this assignment is the same as Asst. 4.

There is no reading/quiz for Tuesday. However, please review the following previous readings (or others from *Open Music Theory*) as necessary.

- [Embellishing tones](http://openmusictheory.com/embellishingTones.html)  
- [Introduction to thoroughbass](http://openmusictheory.com/thoroughbassFigures.html)  
- [Composing in basso-continuo style](http://openmusictheory.com/bassoContinuo.html)
