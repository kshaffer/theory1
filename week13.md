## Assignments

### For Thursday, November 19, 8am

Review the [Composing a cantus firmus resource](http://openmusictheory.com/cantusFirmus.html).

Find a partner, and together compose two *cantus firmi* that follow the principles laid out in the resource — **one in major** and **one in minor.** Notate them **on the alto-clef staff.** Then **make a video** of you and your partner singing each cantus firmus in unison, with solfège and without the assistance of an instrument. Please notate your exercises using a music notation application of your choice. Some possibilities are:

- [Finale](http://finalemusic.com)  
- [Sibelius](http://sibelius.com)  
- [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org)  
- [MuseScore](http://musescore.org)  
- [NoteFlight](http://noteflight.com)  
- [Trinket](http://openmusictheory.com/trinket.html)  

Make use of whatever help/getting-started guides the software makers provide. (We are purposely starting the use of notation software on an assignment that only involves whole notes.)

***Upload the video(s) and the score(s) to the dropbox on the D2L site (Content >> Week 13).*** You can upload it to just one D2L dropbox, and we will enter the grade in both students' grade books.

These will be graded pass/not-pass. A cantus firmus whose composition and performance are error free or contain one small error will pass. Otherwise, you will be given an opportunity to reassess next week.
