## Assignments

### For Thursday, December 10, 8am

Review the [Composing a second-species counterpoint resource](http://openmusictheory.com/secondSpecies.html).

Find a partner, and together compose two second-species counterpoint exercises that follow the principles laid out in the resource — **one in major with the counterpoint *below* the cantus (bass staff)** and **one in minor with the counterpoint *above* the cantus (treble staff).** Use [***one of these cantus firmi***](http://openmusictheory.com/Graphics/counterpoint/cantusFirmi.pdf) as the basis for each exercise. Then **make a video** of you and your partner singing each exercise, one per part, with solfège and without the assistance of an instrument. Please notate your exercises using a music notation application of your choice. Some possibilities are:

- [Finale](http://finalemusic.com)  
- [Sibelius](http://sibelius.com)  
- [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org)  
- [MuseScore](http://musescore.org)  
- [NoteFlight](http://noteflight.com)  
- [Trinket](http://openmusictheory.com/trinket.html)  

Make use of whatever help/getting-started guides the software makers provide. (We are purposely starting the use of notation software on an assignment that only involves whole notes.)

***Upload the video(s) and the score(s) to the dropbox on the D2L site (Content >> Week 15).*** You can upload it to just one D2L dropbox, and we will enter the grade in both students' grade books.

These will be graded pass/not-pass. An exercise whose composition and performance are error free or contain one small error will pass. Otherwise, you will be given an opportunity to reassess next week.


### For Tuesday, December 15, 8am

Final analysis project: details will be provided by Thursday, December 10.
