## Assignments

### For Thursday, December 10, 8am

Review the [Composing a second-species counterpoint resource](http://openmusictheory.com/secondSpecies.html).

Find a partner, and together compose two second-species counterpoint exercises that follow the principles laid out in the resource — **one in major with the counterpoint *below* the cantus (bass staff)** and **one in minor with the counterpoint *above* the cantus (treble staff).** Use [***one of these cantus firmi***](http://openmusictheory.com/Graphics/counterpoint/cantusFirmi.pdf) as the basis for each exercise. Then **make a video** of you and your partner singing each exercise, one per part, with solfège and without the assistance of an instrument. Please notate your exercises using a music notation application of your choice. Some possibilities are:

- [Finale](http://finalemusic.com)  
- [Sibelius](http://sibelius.com)  
- [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org)  
- [MuseScore](http://musescore.org)  
- [NoteFlight](http://noteflight.com)  
- [Trinket](http://openmusictheory.com/trinket.html)  

Make use of whatever help/getting-started guides the software makers provide. (We are purposely starting the use of notation software on an assignment that only involves whole notes.)

***Upload the video(s) and the score(s) to the dropbox on the D2L site (Content >> Week 15).*** You can upload it to just one D2L dropbox, and we will enter the grade in both students' grade books.

These will be graded pass/not-pass. An exercise whose composition and performance are error free or contain one small error will pass. Otherwise, you will be given an opportunity to reassess next week.


### Species reassessments - due Wednesday, December 16, 8am

For any species exercises that you did not pass, you may have a second chance to receive full credit. Take the feedback received, and review it alongside the original reading & video for that species. Then work with your partner to create a new species composition that follows the rules for that species.

Upload all of your reassessment attempts to the D2L dropbox in Content >> Final. As with the first assignment, be sure to submit both a score and a video, following the instructions from the original assignment. Make sure you submit the score in PDF format, so that we can open it even if we do not have the same music notation software.


### Final project: strict counterpoint and "real" music - due Wednesday, December 16, 8am

This project is intended to help you apply the concepts learned in our study of strict counterpoint in the context of less strict musical styles. 

Find two passages of music in any style: one passage that exemplifies one or more principles of species counterpoint (cantus firmus, first species, or second species), and one passage that breaks one or more "rules" of species counterpoint. The principles can be general, such as melodic shape, goal direction, or the progression rest–motion–rest. Or they can be specific, such as approach a perfect consonance by contrary motion or only use consecutive leaps in a melody if together they form a consonant triad. (For an example, think of "When You Were Young" from Thursday's class, which both followed and contradicted various principles of strict counterpoint.) You may use any piece you like, *as long as you do not use "When You Were Young,"* since we discussed it together in class.

Once you have identified your passages, write up the following:

**One short paragraph (probably no more than 100 words) describing how the first passage is an exemplary model of a principle of species counterpoint.** Be as specific as you can, referring to specific musical details.  

For example, "The final five notes of this melody move stepwise and in the same direction (downward), generating strong expectation for the final note, do. This clear directed motion at the melody's end, combined with the common expectation that pieces end with do in the melody, gives it a strong sense of goal orientation ― a core principle of species counterpoint composition."

**One to two paragraphs (approx. 200–500 words) explaining how the second passage contradicts one or more principles of species counterpoint, *and explaining why it makes good musical sense anyway.*** Again, provide specific musical details. Also, while speculation about the *why* is encouraged, try to reference some of the basic principles of music cognition that we have discussed and read about in the past few weeks. 

For example, a passage of music may be dominated by parallel fifths or fourths. You may speculate that this is to make it easy for amateur musicians to improvise harmonizations (Gospel choir music, for example), a performability consideration. However, these parallels will diminish the independence of the lines, possibly making it harder for listeners to distinguish which line is the melody. Are there other musical features that help the performers set the line apart? (difference in volumeor register, instrumental doubling, performing the melody on its own earlier in the song, etc.) Connect both the principles that we have explored formally this semester with your gut instincts as you analyze and interpret this passage. That connection will help you both to internalize the new principles better, and to add nuance and clarity to the instincts you have already formed as practicing musicians.

***Submit your project in D2L.*** Go to Content >> Final to find the dropbox. In the dropbox, upload a score for each passage (if one exists). Then upload your written analyses in a single PDF file. Include both of your analyses in this document. Also include links to an audio source for your passages (Spotify, YouTube, Vimeo, etc.). Finally, be sure to include reference to specific measure numbers/timings for your passage in your written analysis, so we can be sure to find it.

This project will be assessed according to the following objectives:

- Correctly identifies a principle of species counterpoint in a passage.  
- Correctly identifies a passage whose structure contradicts a principle of species counterpoint.  
- Clearly explains the species relationship with specific musical details.  
- Clearly explains the contradiction of the species principle with specific musical details.  
- Accurately references at least one foundational principle of music cognition.  

Each of these objectives will be assessed on a two-point scale. If an objective is met, it receives two points. If it is attempted but not met, one point. If it is not attempted, zero points. The project grade will be a simple percentage taken out of the 10 possible points.
