## Assignments

### For Tuesday, September 8, 7am:

Read/watch the following:

- Review fundamentals chapters in [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com/contents.html) as needed, in light of questions that arose during class and/or preparation for the fundamentals quizzes.  

Take the following quizzes in D2L (under Content >> Week 3):

- Key Signature ID – Sept 8 (3 minutes, one attempt allowed, open-note, no collaboration)  
- Pitch ID – Sept 8 (3 minutes, one attempt allowed, open-note, no collaboration)  
- Scale ID – Sept 8 (5 minutes, one attempt allowed, open-note, no collaboration)  
- Scale-degree ID – Sept 8 (3 minutes, one attempt allowed, open-note, no collaboration)  

*I highly recommend attempting the practice quiz a few times for each of these before taking one that "counts." You can find them under "Practice fundamentals quizzes" in the Content section of our D2L site.*

And finally, do the [fundamentals writing practice assignment](/media/WritingAssignment1.pdf). Print the worksheet, complete as best you can, and turn in at the beginning of class. This will not be scored for a grade, but it will be helpful practice and we will use it to give you helpful feedback in advance of the first fundamentals writing test in a couple weeks. Collaboration is allowed, but I highly recommend that you attempt it on your own first, and then compare your answers with a colleague.
