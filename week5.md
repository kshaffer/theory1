## Assignments

### For Tuesday, September 22, 7am

Read/watch the following:

- [Triads and seventh chords](http://openmusictheory.com/triads.html) (from "Seventh chords" to the end)  

Take the following quizzes in D2L (under Content >> Week 5):

- Reading/video quiz - Sept 22  
- Meter ID - Sept 22  
- any other Sept 22 fundamentals quizzes for categories in which you haven't reached a mastery level (or grade) you are happy with

And finally, do the [fundamentals writing practice assignment](/media/WritingAssignment2.pdf). Print the worksheet, complete as best you can, and turn in at the beginning of class. This will be scored for a grade, and will count towards the *application assignments* category. You are encouraged to study your fundamentals with each other, but the assignment must be your own work, not the result of a collaborative effort. Only assignments with an honor code affirmation signature will be accepted.


### For Thursday, September 24, 8am

There will be no fundamentals quizzes for Thursday. (You will have four more opportunities for the currently open fundamentals quiz topics.) Please review for the fundamentals writing test 1.

Following are some important notes about the fundamentals writing test:

- You may bring a single sheet of 8.5"x11" paper with written notes on it. Otherwise it is a closed-note, closed-book test. Quick work, from memory as much as possible, is the goal.  
- The test will cover your ability to notate the following ten topics on a musical staff: meter & time signatures, rhythmic notation (“bottom-number transposition”), clefs, keys & key signatures, pitches (on treble, alto, and bass staves), scales, melodic transpositions, intervals, triads, and seventh chords.  
- The format will be similar to the exercises on the two written homework assignments.  
- There will be a second fundamentals writing test in Week 8. On that test, you reassess any musical topics you like. The best score from those two tests *for each individual topic* will count towards your semester grade.

We will have time to discuss any questions you have in class on Tuesday.
