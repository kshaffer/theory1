## Assignments

### For Tuesday, September 22, 7am

Read/watch the following:

- [Triads and seventh chords](http://openmusictheory.com/triads.html) (from "Seventh chords" to the end)  

Take the following quizzes in D2L (under Content >> Week 5):

- Reading/video quiz - Sept 22  
- Meter ID - Sept 22  
- any other Sept 22 fundamentals quizzes for categories in which you haven't reached a mastery level (or grade) you are happy with

And finally, do the [fundamentals writing practice assignment](/media/WritingAssignment2.pdf) (link forthcoming). Print the worksheet, complete as best you can, and turn in at the beginning of class. This will not be scored for a grade, but it will be helpful practice and we will use it to give you helpful feedback in advance of the first fundamentals writing test in a couple weeks. Collaboration is allowed, but I highly recommend that you attempt it on your own first, and then compare your answers with a colleague.


### For Thursday, September 24, 8am

Review for the fundamentals writing test 1.

Optional: take any Sept 24 fundamentals quizzes for categories in which you haven't reached a mastery level (or grade) you are happy with.
