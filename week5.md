- any other Sept 22 fundamentals quizzes for categories in which you haven't reached a mastery level (or grade) you are happy with

And finally, do the [fundamentals writing practice assignment](/media/WritingAssignment2.pdf). Print the worksheet, complete as best you can, and turn in at the beginning of class. This will be scored for a grade, and will count towards the *application assignments* category. You are encouraged to study your fundamentals with each other, but the assignment must be your own work, not the result of a collaborative effort. Only assignments with an honor code affirmation signature will be accepted.
