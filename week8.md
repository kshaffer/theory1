## Assignments

### For Tuesday, October 13, 7am

Complete the [Mozart Piano Sonata, K. 283, reduction activity]({{ site.url }}/media/K283-ii-reductionBlank.pdf) begun in class on Oct. 6. In addition to the instructions printed on the handout, circle all embellishing tones and label them by type according to the [Embellishing Tones](http://openmusictheory.com/embellishingTones.html) resource on OMT as best you can. Make sure every note is accounted for, either as part of the reduction or as an embellishing tone. Keep in mind that there are more than one legitimate musical interpretation. If you can match what you hear to specific musical details that support it, you're on the right track. If you have trouble with the harmonic reduction, write down the questions you have and bring them to class, then use the [model reduction]({{ site.url }}/media/K283-ii-reductionModel.pdf) that I provided you, and circle all embellishing tones and label them by type. (This assignment is ungraded, but we will go over it in preparation for a grading assignment of the same type, though more straightforward, for Thursday.)

Also, take the following quizzes in D2L (under Content >> Week 8):

- Seventh chord ID - Oct 13


### For Thursday, October 15, 7am

Prepare for the second (and final) fundamentals writing test. You only have to do the parts of the test that you did not do well on the first time. The best score from these two tests *for each individual section* will contribute to your final grade for fundamentals writing.
