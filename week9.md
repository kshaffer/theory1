## Assignments

### For Tuesday, October 20, 8am

Complete [Written Assignment No. 4]({{ site.url }}/media/WritingAssignment4.pdf) to hand in at the beginning of class. Be sure to follow *all of the instructions* on the assignment. If you did not come to the exam on Thursday and did not receive one of these, there is an envelope on my office door (N138) containing many printed copies. You can also, of course, print the PDF. The [Embellishing Tones](http://openmusictheory.com/embellishingTones.html) resource on OMT may be helpful as you work on this. As usual, keep in mind that there is often more than one legitimate musical interpretation. If you can match what you hear to specific musical details that support it, you're on the right track. This assignment will count toward the application assignments part of your course grade.

Also, please read the following and take the Oct 19 Reading Quiz in D2L (under Content >> Week 9):

- [Introduction to thoroughbass](http://openmusictheory.com/thoroughbassFigures.html)  
- [Composing in basso-continuo style](http://openmusictheory.com/bassoContinuo.html)  
- [A brief history of basso-continuo keyboard-style voice-leading](http://openmusictheory.com/bassoContinuo-history.html) (optional, for those interested in the historical background to some of what we're doing this week)  

*Please note that you do NOT have to follow the new voicing and voice-leading principles in these readings on Written Assignment No. 4. You ONLY have to worry about following the Law of the Shortest Way and the specific instructions provided on the assignment.*
